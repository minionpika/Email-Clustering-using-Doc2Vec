# Email-Clustering-using-Doc2Vec
This is a machine learning project. Enron email dataset, doc2vec model by gensim 3.4 and clustering algorithms have been used for clustering user mails.

If you want to run this project, download the .py file along with the dataset.
Then just run it. I have used Pycharm for this project.
