This is a machine learning project. Enron email dataset, doc2vec model by gensim 3.4 and clustering algorithms have been used for clustering user mails.

If you want to run this project, download the project along with the dataset given in the requirements.txt. Then just run it.

emails_2only.csv contains only 2 different emails for testing purpose marked as green in the output image file.
I have used Pycharm for this project.
